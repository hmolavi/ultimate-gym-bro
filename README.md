# Getting Started
You can run the module on your device or through Repl

## Running in Replit
Go to my Repl repository and deploy by running this into the shell terminal
``` bash
deploy.py
```
## Running on Localhost

Initially you need to setup a Python virtual environment. You can do so by running the following:

```bash
python3.8 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3.8 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, run your agent:

```bash
python3.8 main.py
```
