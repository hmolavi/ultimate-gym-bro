# Getting Started
You can run the module on your device or on cloud through Repl. Try changing the personality of the agent by editing the string at the bottom of src/api.py file!

## Running in Replit
Go to my <a href="https://replit.com/@hmolavi/Ultimate-Gym-Bro">Repl </a> repository and deploy project by pasting deploy.py into shell terminal
``` bash
deploy.py
```
Click on the steamship link and create your account. Create an instance of the module, you will be redirected to a new page where you can either chat there or connect to a Telegram bot which require seperate instructions.
## Running on Localhost
Initially you need to setup a Python virtual environment. You can do so by running the following:
```bash
python3.8 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3.8 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then, run your agent:
```bash
python3.8 main.py
```
